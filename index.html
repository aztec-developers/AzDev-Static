                <p>
                Aztec Developers is a student organization at SDSU full of people looking to improve their overall knowledge in the constantly developing world of technology. We are here to learn new skills and have fun doing it, we welcome anyone looking to explore and learn new things. AzDev meetings are broken up into two sections, a discussion section, and a hack section.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Section:</h3>
                <p>The discussion section is the first 20-30 minutes of the meeting during in which members and industry experts give short talks on topics relating to Computer Science, software engineering, and technology.</p>
                <h3>Hack Section:</h3>
                <p>The hack section is similar to going to a (more relaxed) hackathon and is all about making cool stuff. Heres how it works: </p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Form Teams: </strong>Members are randomly broken up into teams and given this week's challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Stuff: </strong>Teams then have until the next meeting to work together on this problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Show what you made: </strong>At the following meeting after the discussion phase, teams will give a short two-minute presentation of what they made, why they made it, and what they learned. </li>
                </ol>
                After all the presentations, we pick a winning team, which wins some small prizes and gets to pick the next challenge.</p>

                    Do I need to do anything to join?
                </div>
                To keep things up and running we do require new members to pay a $25 membership fee. This allows us to provide server space for projects, have food/drinks for our meetings, and it gets you a sweet t-shirt!
                <div class="card-title">
                    What level of knowledge do I need previous to joining?
                </div>
                No previous knowledge is required! We are all here to learn and grow, our members are more than happy to assist those that may be new to the software development or just want to learn new things.
                <div class="card-title">
                    What if I'm not a Computer Science major?
                </div>
                Not a problem. We are open to anyone and everyone looking to gain knowledge or make cool things. With that being said, we are software development oriented but by no means will we restrict you, regardless of technical ability.
                <div class="card-title">
                    Can any grade level join?
                </div>
                Yes, AzDev is for everyone, beginners and experts.

                    What do I need to bring to meetings?
                </div>
                For hackathons at meetings you will need to come equipped with a computer to work on. Other than that, just an eagerness to learn and to have fun.
