                    Do I need to do anything to join?
                </div>
                To keep things up and running we do require new members to pay a $25 membership fee. This allows us to provide server space for projects, have food/drinks for our meetings, and it gets you a sweet t-shirt!
                <div class="card-title">
                    What level of knowledge do I need previous to joining?
                </div>
                No previous knowledge is required! We are all here to learn and grow, our members are more than happy to assist those that may be new to the space or simply haven't used the tools we are familiar with.
                <div class="card-title">
                    What if I'm not a Computer Science major?
                </div>
                Not a problem. We are open to anyone and everyone looking to gain knowledge in the tech space. That said we are software development oriented but if that's for you then AzDev is a great place to get that fix.
                <div class="card-title">
                    Can any grade level join?
                </div>
                YES! We will not turn away anyone looking to join, this club is based around learning and spreading experience especially to those new to tech which many lower grade levels might be.
                <div class="card-title">
                    What do I need to bring to meetings?
                </div>
                We do live code hackathons at meetings so you will need to come equipped with a laptop to work on and hack away with. Other than that, just an eagerness to learn and to have fun.
                <div class="card-title">
                    What sort of tools do you use?
                </div>
                All of our members use a wide variety of tools for developing, and our members are more than happy to share their expertise and experience with those tools. Some examples of what our members are using are frameworks for the web such as Polymer and React, or different text editors such as Atom or Vim, or languages from Java to Elixir, we are always looking for cutting edge technologies and making use of the oldest ones. If you're looking for knowdlegde in any software related area, odds are one of our members has worked with it.
                <div class="card-title">
                    What is a hackathon?
                </div>
                Good question! Since this is something that our club is based around it's probably something good to cover. So a hackathon is a competition where small groups of developers work together to build some awesome software, sometimes under certain guidelines for a challenge, and other times it's a free for all, just go crazy. In our case we will be having challenge based hackathons, where teams will be created evenly based on experience, then they will work to complete a project that addresses the challenge. At the end everyone will vote on a winning project (except their own) and that team will get to choose the next challenge the club will take part in.
